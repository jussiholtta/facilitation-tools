## Super simple facilitation tools

These tools have been built for my own use as a facilitator. Often repeated small things that I don't want to do manually every time. Currently 0 online functionality, everything that happens on the page, stays on the page and **is not stored**

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jussiholtta/facilitation-tools/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### Timer
Full screen timer, designed to be shared on Zoom to give a visual timer for everyone while they do something else.
