## Super simple facilitation tools

These tools have been built for my own use as a facilitator. Often repeated small things that I don't want to do manually every time. Currently 0 online functionality, everything that happens on the page, stays on the page and **is not stored**

Only basic functionality implemented.

TODO:
Make these pretty and responsive.
Make anyrandomizer load urls to iframes or something like that?

### Timer
Full screen timer, designed to be shared on Zoom to give a visual timer for everyone while they do something else.

### Randompicture
Pic 1-54 random pictures from a static set of SVG pictures.

### Anyrandomizer
Randomize a comma separated list of strings.
